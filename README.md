# notion-rss
Get RSS feeds in notion.so


## Nice to haves
- Remove old, unread/starred items
- Use rss.Item.Content into notion blocks so the content can be viewed in Notion.
- Add Categories to RSS items, and notion content tables.
- Convert combined RSS feeds into single feed: https://github.com/gorilla/feeds
